# Trunk-Task

This project is a task management application that allows users to create job cards and manage workstations. The application is built using NestJS framework with a PostgreSQL database. The state of each task can be changed by updating its corresponding record in the database with one of four possible states. It uses Event-Driven Microservice approach, events are persisted within the database and they are used to loosely couple system components.
